2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries by running:
``` http
  pip install requests
```
4. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website.
5. Create a file named key.py in the project directory and define a variable API_KEY to store your API key. For example:
``` http
  API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Executing Program
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the project.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:
